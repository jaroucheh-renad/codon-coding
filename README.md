# codon-coding

## Aim
I created this script to perform decoding of codons on an mRNA transcript. It is designed for anyone interested in learning more about the use of computing in biology, allowing users to experiment with how each codon codes for translation. This script can process mRNA sequences to decode codons into translation.

## Key Features
- Basic mRNA codon decoding.
- Introduction to computational biology using Python.

## What you should already have
- Python (I use version: 3.11)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jaroucheh-renad/bio-dna-example.git
   cd bio-dna-example
   ```

2. Install required packages:
  ```
  pip install biopython
  ```
3. Running the script
   ```
   python test.py
   ```
